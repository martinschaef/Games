# Tortoise and Hare

## Simulation: (The Tortoise and the Hare) 

In this exercise, you will re-create the classic race of the tortoise and the hare. You will use ```random number generation``` to develop a simulation of this memorable event.


Our contenders begin the race at "square 1" of 70 squares. Each square represents a possible position along the race course. The finish line is at ```square 70```. The first contender to reach or pass ```square 70``` is rewarded with a pail of fresh carrots and lettuce. The course weaves its way up the side of a slippery mountain, so occasionally the contenders lose ground.

There is a clock that ticks once per second. With each tick of the clock, your program should adjust the position of the animals according to the rules in the following figure.

### Rules for moving the tortoise and the hare.

```
Animal                 Move type                 Percentage of the time            Actual move
Tortoise               Fast plod                 50%                               3 squares to the right
                       Slip                      20%                               6 squares to the left
                       Slow Plod                 30%                               1 squares to the right
                        

Hare                   Sleep                     20%                               No move at all
                       Big hop                   20%                               9 squares to the right
                       Big slip                  10%                               12 squares to the left
                       Small hop                 30%                               1 square to the right
                       Small slip                20%                               2 squares to the left

```

Use variables to keep track of the positions of the animals (i.e., position numbers are 0 - 70). Start each animal at position 0 (i.e., the "starting gate"). If an animal slips left before square 0, move the animal back to square 0.

Generate the percentages in the preceding table by producing a random integer i in the range ```0 £ i < 10.``` For the tortoise, perform a "fast plod" when ```0 £ i < 5,``` a "slip" when ```5 £ i £ 6 ``` or a "slow plod" when ```7 £ i £ 9.``` Use a similar technique to move the hare.




#### Begin the race by printing

##### BANG !!!!!

##### AND THEY'RE OFF !!!!!



For each tick of the clock (i.e., each repetition of a loop), print a 70-position line showing the letter ```T``` in the tortoise's position and the letter ```H``` in the hare's position. Occasionally, the contenders land on the same square. In this case, the tortoise bites the hare and your program should print ```OUCH!!!``` beginning at that position. All print positions other than the ```T```, the ```H ```or the ```OUCH!!!``` (in case of a tie) should be blank.

After printing each line, test if either animal has reached or passed square 70. If so, print the winner and terminate the simulation. If the tortoise wins, print ```TORTOISE WINS!!! YAY!!!``` If the hare wins, print ```Hare wins. Yuch.``` If both animals win on the same clock tick, you may want to favor the tortoise (the "underdog"), or you may want to print ```It's a tie.``` If neither animal wins, perform the loop again to simulate the next tick of the clock. 

When you are ready to run your program, assemble a group of fans to watch the race. You'll be amazed how involved the audience gets!
